# jarusll.github.io/surajyadav.xyz #

This is my personal site. 
It contains 3 submodules
  * Diary - daily updates
  * Posts - pieces
  * Fragments - anything which cannot be called a piece

It also has my artworks but it isn't its submodule.

This is built using the 11ty framework. Its minimal & uses markdown for pages.
I had my previous site built using Next.JS, [here](https://github.com/jarusll/oldportfolio).

I needed a minimal, hassle free setup which is loosely coupled and can run till I am an old guy typing with brain waves thingy surrounded by nature.
