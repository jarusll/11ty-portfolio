  <h1>2022-04-03</h1>
<p>finished clojurescript koans first thing in the morning.</p>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] come up with a design for shorts</li>
<li>[ ] edit clojurescript koans videos</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to start making realistic plans. Looking back I am not able to finish everything I plan for. I'll be easing it now.<br>
In a day, I am only able to do one big task. So I'll just plan a semi big task for a day.</p>
<p>I have been using mechvibes since yesterday. Its cool. <a href="https://mechvibes.com">https://mechvibes.com</a>. I like the sound of Blacks. Blues have this springy tone at the end<br>
and its annoying.</p>
<p>I forgot to delete my lightsail instances and I've been charged for 3 months now. I did disable the instance.</p>
<p>Things I need to do for the edit</p>
<ul>
<li>Line up the videos</li>
<li>Transitions(maybe)</li>
<li>Background music(lofi chill)</li>
<li>Color grading(warm and low contrast)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is just too much to learn about video editing. I will give this a day more.<br>
I am blurring things out right now. I am yet to add text banners. Commentary is out of the question.</p>
<p>Editing is a bitch. I did an amateur of not doing things in incognito and I now have to blur things out. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
<h1>2022-04-02</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] setup <code>shorts</code> on portfolio</li>
<li>[ ] record screencast of solving clojure koans at <a href="http://clojurescriptkoans.com">http://clojurescriptkoans.com</a></li>
<li>[ ] watch some linear video editing</li>
<li>[x] play dota with the bois, been a while since I played(played lol)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll read some short stories today.<br>
One of these days need to think about seamless images integration on portfolio. I can add image in diary but they get added in<br>
diary repo, that directory hasn't been configured for images. There will be more resources directories in future. Need a futureproof(enough)<br>
solution.</p>
<p>Next week I'll setup RSS for my portfolio.</p>
<p><img src="/images/45c1d0ac5c158dbe491e518249607dc5.jpg" alt="My Setup"><br>
<em>My Setup</em></p>
<p>Testing image.<br>
Needs to be prefixed by <code>/images/</code>. Testing again.<br>
Works.</p>
<p>Images can be easily added by passthrough copy in 11ty. The raw images uploaded from phone would be unoptimized but this will suffice for now.</p>
<p>I am still yet to design the setup for shorts. Since there will be lots of posts, I will need filtering.</p>
<p>Halfway through clojure koans.<br>
Once I have a stable recording setup I can start recording other things.</p>
<h1>2022-04-01</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] look into org mode</li>
<li>[x] fuck around github copilot</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll start applying for jobs soon.</p>
<p>I love github copilot. No, it won't make people lose their jobs, it'll help them grow as a dev.<br>
One of the things will be sensible names when they try to use copilot suggestions. For me it'll be generating boilerplate, discoverability(with caution)<br>
and automating trivial things. I will decompose my problem more and thus improve my code quality.</p>
<p>I have made a Point class library for fun. That library can have some more functions if I had Angle class. I will be making the Angle class<br>
with the help of github copilot. Lets see how this goes.</p>
<p>Looks like there's no pornhub comments api, just scraping solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://game.postdoesnotexist.com/">https://game.postdoesnotexist.com/</a> - Good game</p>
<p><code>faces</code> are typefaces in emacs. Can customize to my liking.</p>
<p>I was thinking about making a <code>shorts</code> section on my site. There are things which shouldn't go in my diary but shorts.</p>
<p>Charu cute.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be working on shorts section. I was also planning on doing screencasts. Maybe I can combine both of these in one section. They will be fragments of cool things which don't belong in my diary.</p>
<p>Night friend.</p>
<h1>2022-03-31</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] finish elisp koans</li>
<li>[ ] draw portal companion cube</li>
</ul>
<p>Have been looking into guix, this is definitely something I'll look into someday.</p>
<p>I want someone cute, I want to read, write and fuck around computers.</p>
<p>I feel like I have familiarized myself with emacs well to move around quick enough. Next plan would be to setting custom keybinds.</p>
<p>Emacs has a diary. I looked into it. My current setup works for now given that I push from my phone as well.</p>
<p>All this time I have been on a scavenged linux setup. I picked the first obvious solution &amp; stuck to it. I really want to craft a system and stick to it.<br>
The setup will be</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal</li>
<li>stable</li>
<li>deterministic</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't looked at guix yet but scheme as config language does seem appealing to me plus its something new so fun.</p>
<p>I read some of &quot;One more thing: stories &amp; other stories&quot;. Good short stories.</p>
<p>I looked at nixos, I like the idea. Now I need to find out &amp; justify if it works for me.</p>
<p>I finished the koans, there are 2 koans but they are exercise. I might do them if I feel like it. Right now, I have to digest some elisp. I'll come back to these after a day or two.</p>
<p>Haven't been able to do alot these days because I have been helping at home. If it becomes extreme I might look for a laptop or travel keyboard so I can work from phone.</p>
<p>Good day, night friend.</p>
<h1>2022-03-30</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] finish elisp koans</li>
<li>[x] setup krita/libresprite for drawing</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy day, woke up late. Need to fix my sleep schedule. I wish I can get back my lost sleep but that's not possible.</p>
<p>I'll draw the portal companion cube today.</p>
<p>One of these days need to think about seo. It feels spammy and unethical. I'll keep it clean.</p>
<p>Found out a really sweet <a href="http://clojurescriptkoans.com/">Clojure Koans website</a>. Will give it a try soon.</p>
<p>Helped out Xeon with his assignment today. Java isn't that bad. I'll give it a try someday.</p>
<p><code>&quot;CL (and elisp!) provides the programmer with more than enough rope to hang themself.&quot;</code> - <em>elisp-koans</em></p>
<p>I like introspection. Thats one of the big reasons I like emacs &amp; smalltalk.</p>
<h1>2022-03-29</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] figure out data sources for d2newspaper</li>
<li>[ ] do elisp koans</li>
<li>[x] watch system crafters</li>
</ul>
<p>Came across <code>elcord-mode</code>, discord rich presense for emacs. Looks cool.<br>
<code>recentf-mode</code>, remembers all the recent files. I am using it now.</p>
<p>Just found out about <code>describe-symbol</code> in emacs. It gives documentation about elisp symbols.</p>
<p>One thing that I really want to master in emacs is motions, moving around in buffer fast, really fast. Thats the thing I liked about Vim alot. If I can make it happen here, I won't need any vi emulation modes.</p>
<p>One of these days I'll draw the portal companion cube artwork. I got one online but it seems unethical. I'll make my own.</p>
<p>Seems like <code>ssh-add</code> doesn't persist. I don't know how long but it doesn't. I am trying out <code>git config credential.helper store</code>. Lets see if this works.</p>
<p>I know just enough about elisp so that I can read the manual &amp; get stuff done.<br>
Also the credential helper thing doesn't store any ssh keys. I'll have to look into it soon.</p>
<p>Found out <code>which-key</code>, It lists all the commands available in current mode.<br>
Here's a preview from <img src="https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key/raw/master/img/which-key-bottom.png" alt="justbur/emacs-which-key"><br>
This is very helpful. I can just scroll through the commands to see what action I want, It shows the keybind as well. After a while it'll become second nature.</p>
<p>Me and Wolfie figured out how to get all the data for d2newspaper. We'll be using jq to filter out. Should be easy. ezpz.</p>
<p>Holy shit <code>which-key</code> is fucking awesome. If I enable <code>which-key-mode</code>, I can type out Key combinations and wait for the suggestions. This is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Actually good day, learnt alot about Emacs. Day rating - 6/10. Tomorrow I'll try to finish elisp-koans.<br>
Ez, night friend</p>
<h1>2022-03-28</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] setup <code>D2Newspaper</code></li>
<li>[x] fix posts github script</li>
<li>[ ] setup git on android</li>
</ul>
<p>The mount is here. Power tools are scary.<br>
I have enough desk space now, I can use my drawing tablet.<br>
I set it up everything. I ll play Far Changing Tides, I've earned it.</p>
<p>I'll be messing around with emacs lisp for a while. My goal is to start talking in terms of emacs objects like buffers, windows &amp; frames and then write some trivial macros.</p>
<p>Man I love magit, I am quickly able to do git actions which is letting me make rapid small changes. Good stuff.</p>
<p>I'll be trying out <a href="https://github.com/jtmoulia/elisp-koans">elisp koans</a><br>
I did some elisp koans. I expected emacs types but this is standard lisp stuff.<br>
Anyways the youtube series by System Crafters should get me upto speed with emacs types.</p>
<p>I wanted to open my diary file quickly, I came across emacs registers. You can store any thing, good stuff. I stored my diary file at d. So I can access it by <code>C-x r j d</code> from anywhere in emacs. ezpz.</p>
<p>Easy day, pushed &quot;What motivates me&quot;, started with elisp. System crafters should get me upto speed with Emacs.</p>
<p>Planned about d2newspaper. Lets make this happen.</p>
<p>Night friend</p>
<h1>2022-03-27</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] setup <code>D2Newspaper</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There's alot of dust buildup in my pc, need to clean it. I ll do it when the mount arrives.</p>
<p>Wolfie talked about how he's missing reading books and now I want to read🥺. I will gain momentum first with short reads.</p>
<p>Pushed draft of &quot;What motivates me&quot;</p>
<p>Now that everything has been automated and decoupled, I can write articles on my phone. Need to find a good git app for Android.</p>
<p>Wolfie busy, we ll setup tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just realised I have misconfigured GitHub actions for posts and no listener for posts_push on portfolio. Will fix it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Absolutely not having chicken again.</p>
<p>Day rating - 5/10. My eyes were strained and I lost all dota matches but Charu cheered me up</p>
<h1>2022-03-26</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] add site build trigger on <code>posts</code> push</li>
<li>[x] integrate artworks</li>
<li>[ ] push <code>why i like smalltalk - message protocols</code></li>
<li>[ ] add `` markdown highlights</li>
</ul>
<p>Holy shit webp is good.<br>
Just found out I can add ssh keys and I won't have to input password. VERY BIG, love it, my life is easy.</p>
<p>Its been a while since I had any day off, tomorrow is my day. No work tomorrow. I ll play dota and draw.</p>
<p><code>The Green Knight</code> was the last decent movie I saw. I might watch some <code>Monty Python</code>.</p>
<p>Me and Wolfie discussed about the Destiny thing(<code>D2Newspaper</code> for now). I'll be working on it with him.</p>
<h1>2022-03-25</h1>
<p>Like LoL characters, but the game feels like a mobile game. Might give it one more try.</p>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] integrate diary</li>
<li>[ ] push <code>why i like smalltalk - message protocols</code></li>
<li>[x] think about artworks integration</li>
<li>[ ] plan for destiny thing with Wolfie</li>
</ul>
<p>Played roblox with Joles, it went... okay.<br>
Man i love playing Oracle</p>
<p>I have my <code>posts</code> repo as gitsubmodule in <code>portfolio</code> repo and whenever I make a change in posts, I have to commit it twice, once in <code>post</code> &amp; once in <code>portfolio</code>.<br>
I just want to commit once and be done</p>
<p>Integrated Dark mode, ezpz</p>
<p>One of these days, need to plan about decoupling the submodules and building the site on push of any dependency repos</p>
<p>Oh hello git submodules</p>
<p>I did it, ahahah. I am a fucking god. I successfully tested GitHub actions trigger on push in submodule repo.</p>
<p>Lets see if this works.</p>
<p>Yes it does, ahahahahahahaah.</p>
<p>Automated site build on submodule push. I did it for diary so I can write from phone, push and everything will just work. Tomorrow I'll do the same for posts</p>
<p>Good day, Charu cute, night friend</p>
<h1>2022-03-24</h1>
<p>Hello friend</p>
<p>Charu... Cute... 24th November</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just let it crash and drop in debugger, we'll define things on the fly - <em>Some wise smalltalk programmer</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy day, dint really get much done. Pushed &quot;Why I made a public diary&quot; and made the diary.</p>
<p>Need to clone the diary repo in GitHub workflow.</p>
