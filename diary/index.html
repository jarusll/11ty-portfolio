<p>The mount is here. Power tools are scary.<br>
I have enough desk space now, I can use my drawing tablet.<br>
I set it up everything. I ll play Far Changing Tides, I've earned it.</p>
<p>I'll be messing around with emacs lisp for a while. My goal is to start talking in terms of emacs objects like buffers, windows &amp; frames and then write some trivial macros.</p>

<h3>Plan for today</h3>

</ul>
<p>There's alot of dust buildup in my pc, need to clean it. I ll do it when the mount arrives.</p>
<p>Wolfie talked about how he's missing reading books and now I want to readðŸ¥º. I will gain momentum first with short reads.</p>
<p>Pushed draft of &quot;What motivates me&quot;</p>
<p>Now that everything has been automated and decoupled, I can write articles on my phone. Need to find a good git app for Android.</p>
<p>Wolfie busy, we ll setup tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just realised I have misconfigured GitHub actions for posts and no listener for posts_push on portfolio. Will fix it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Absolutely not having chicken again.</p>
<p>Day rating - 5/10. My eyes were strained and I lost all dota matches but Charu cheered me up</p>
<h1>2022-03-26</h1>

<p>Holy shit webp is good.<br>
Just found out I can add ssh keys and I won't have to input password. VERY BIG, love it, my life is easy.</p>
<p>Its been a while since I had any day off, tomorrow is my day. No work tomorrow. I ll play dota and draw.</p>
<p><code>The Green Knight</code> was the last decent movie I saw. I might watch some <code>Monty Python</code>.</p>
<p>Me and Wolfie discussed about the Destiny thing(<code>D2Newspaper</code> for now). I'll be working on it with him.</p>
<h1>2022-03-25</h1>
<p>Like LoL characters, but the game feels like a mobile game. Might give it one more try.</p>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] integrate diary</li>
<li>[ ] push <code>why i like smalltalk - message protocols</code></li>
<li>[x] think about artworks integration</li>
<li>[ ] plan for destiny thing with Wolfie</li>
</ul>
<p>Played roblox with Joles, it went... okay.<br>
Man i love playing Oracle</p>
<p>I have my <code>posts</code> repo as gitsubmodule in <code>portfolio</code> repo and whenever I make a change in posts, I have to commit it twice, once in <code>post</code> &amp; once in <code>portfolio</code>.<br>
I just want to commit once and be done</p>
<p>Integrated Dark mode, ezpz</p>
<p>One of these days, need to plan about decoupling the submodules and building the site on push of any dependency repos</p>
<p>Oh hello git submodules</p>
<p>I did it, ahahah. I am a fucking god. I successfully tested GitHub actions trigger on push in submodule repo.</p>
<p>Lets see if this works.</p>
<p>Yes it does, ahahahahahahaah.</p>
<p>Automated site build on submodule push. I did it for diary so I can write from phone, push and everything will just work. Tomorrow I'll do the same for posts</p>
<p>Good day, Charu cute, night friend</p>
<h1>2022-03-24</h1>
