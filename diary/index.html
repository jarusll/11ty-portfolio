  <h1>2022-05-01</h1>
<p>Plan is to solve BST &amp; Linked Lists today and look into bit masking.</p>
<h1>2022-04-30</h1>
<p>Solved some Binary search &amp; Linked List problems. The 14 day plan of Leetcode is locked, I can't access all of them at once.<br>
I am very comfortable with Binary search now.<br>
I will be doing BSTs and Linked lists tomorrow.<br>
I am going to treat myself with icecream.</p>
<p>Leetcode still did that thing of passing Wrong Answer verdict for a working solution. I do not know what the issue is and I cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p>Solved some more of linked list. I missed recursion. Its back.</p>
<p>I feel I am ramping up with my problem solving skills. I don't wanna lose this momentum. Its been a while since I had this rush of problem solving. I want to continue doing this consistently.</p>
<p>Good day, Night</p>
<h1>2022-04-29</h1>
<p>Solved 2 problems in morning.<br>
Something's wrong with leetcode. The submit test cases flag Wrong Answer(WA) but when I check on local, it gives me correct answer.<br>
To verify it I ran the failing test case in leetcode's test cases and it gave correct answer but submission is flagging wrong answer.</p>
<p>I like memoization.</p>
<p>I saw The Mitchell's vs. The Machines, like the artstyle.</p>
<p>Solved some problems with Jun. Tried out other domains as well.</p>
<p>Good day</p>
<h1>2022-04-28</h1>
<p>Solved 3 problems so far. Good start for the day.</p>
<p>Been a while since I played dota. Imma play some today.</p>
<p>I am going to deep dry clean my keyboard today.</p>
<p>Solved 5 problems in total today. I am picking up basics of algo analysis.</p>
<p>Good day, Night</p>
<h1>2022-04-27</h1>
<p>If it compiles, it works. Am I right? - <em>Some rust programmer</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/2f34c02994684b2cc351b079904cf163.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Leetcode is tough. I might have to take it at this pace, slow.</p>
<p>Solved 2 problems today. Good day.</p>
<p>Night</p>
<h1>2022-04-26</h1>
<p>I have to fight the compiler alot with Rust.</p>
<p>Nope, rust is definitely not suitable for competitive programming for me.</p>
<p>Elegant code &gt; everything.</p>
<p>I could only solve 1 problem today. While taking things slow is good but the languages feel inadequate. They don't support the verbs I want to work it. Something as simple as position-if function. I want these high order functions at my disposal.<br>
I might have to build my own library.</p>
<p>Night</p>
<h1>2022-04-25</h1>
<p>I solved one more problem today. I'll ramp up as I go.<br>
I am solving rustlings, will make rust my competetive programming language.</p>
<p>I have integrated asserts in my programming, poor mans tdd. I like it.</p>
<p>Speed is not my priority when it comes to problem solving, readability is.</p>
<h1>2022-04-24</h1>
<p>Tried out some easy leetcode problems and I really need to catchup.<br>
I solved with python because it was the quickest to setup with tdd. I'll move on to cpp.</p>
<p>Spent some time looking into autotools.<br>
I wrote an emacs babel function for evaluating python functions in org-mode.</p>
<p>I don't like language quirks. I want determinism. I don't want to spend an hour on abs function which gives segmentation fault.<br>
I might have to try out rust or typescript.</p>
<p>Good day, Grind starts tomorrow.</p>
<h1>2022-04-23</h1>
<p>The amount of boilerplate in java is bonkers. I am ditching it. I'll use smalltalk.</p>
<p>Helped Xeon with his project, and the issue was Java's build system. I don't know why it has to be so complex.</p>
<p>I slept today. Tomorrow's my day off as well. Only reading.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nWKPYs54INA">Your love is my drug</a></p>
<p>Night</p>
<h1>2022-04-22</h1>
<p>I started with the TDD practice. I will finish the first exercise.</p>
<p>Coming monday Leetcode grind starts. I will fuck around my personal things until this weekend, from monday strict DSA.</p>
<p>I realised the testing things pretty easy if you are good at design, which smalltalk taught me.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/04RO1gAZbF34O2gv0Oak5U?si=lfdELlM0SgCfXZbESUv8Aw">Dr. Ziltch</a> slaps</p>
<p>I have been trying out the tdd in Javascript which doesn't really have good OOP support, It lacks some fundamentals. I am looking into Java, Java By Comparision - Pragmatic Bookshelf</p>
<p>Everything is just smalltalk &amp; lisp. I don't need to learn the langauge, I just need to know its workflow, eg compilation, namespaces.</p>
<p>I'll look into Competetive programming books now. I'll setup the tdd setup with java tomorrow.</p>
<p>Came across yasnippets, I'll use and abuse it.</p>
<p>I'll get comfortable with Java tomorrow and start with some leetcode easy problems</p>
<p>Good day, night</p>
<h1>2022-04-21</h1>
<p>My cousin's here, we played Minecraft. I recommended him Portal, my first pc game.</p>
<p>I am not getting any pc time today, he's been playing Portal. I'll read.</p>
<p><img src="/images/406a765d5812d69a243823ee1933f172.jpg" alt="Image"><br>
<em>Test subject recruited</em></p>
<p>I finished the Unit testing section. I can start tdd.</p>
<p>I started reading TDD by Example by Kent Beck. I am going to setup my TDD repo and fuck around some test cases.</p>
<p>From what I've read about Gnomes, it suits my character. But I'll look for other races as well, I don't care how niche it gets. I am pretty sure about class, Druid.</p>
<p>Good day, night.</p>
<h1>2022-04-20</h1>
<p>Whenever a merge error happens, my GitJournal breaks. It happened today and I couldn't write from phone.</p>
<p>I read today, alot. I am halfway through the testing book. I also looked that <code>Players Handbook</code> for DND.<br>
I like where I am headed as a dev. Docker then testing.</p>
<p>My cat is pregnant. Lets hope they make it this time.</p>
<p>My DND character is Aarakocra Druid, once he levels up he'll be able to fly. And he already has a power of transforming into any other form. I feel like this would be too much power. I'll rethink my character's race.</p>
<p>Here are some of the attributes I want my character to have</p>
<ul>
<li>lives in nature, around trees</li>
<li>hungry for knowledge</li>
<li>lone wolf</li>
<li>4-5ft tall, nimble</li>
<li>lives over 500+ years</li>
<li>can transform to any other form</li>
<li>does whatever the fuck he likes, without worrying about consequences</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll dedicate a piece to my character</p>
<p>Good day, I am having absolute blast playing Invoker.<br>
Night</p>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<h1>2022-04-19</h1>
<p>I know when I miss programming.</p>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox0"><label for="checkbox0">try some testing katas</label></li>
</ul>
<p>I recently found out about Socratic Dialogue. And the reason its big for me is because the two books which had a big impact on me as a developer were written that way.<br>
The Little Schemer &amp; The Seasoned Schemer are written as Socratic dialogue.</p>
<p>I am going to read the 3rd book in the series The Reasoned Schemer, which is based on relational programming soon. I plan to read more of this style. Good stuff.</p>
<p>I will be reading alot for a while.</p>
<p>I have been itching alot to mess around with testing. Especially TDD. I am looking into it.</p>
<p>I started reading <code>Unit Testing: Principles, Practices &amp; Patterns</code>. I really want to tinker with a good oop system but the only one which I like is smalltalk, nothing comes closer to the interactability of its IDE. I'll try it after testing for TDD.</p>
<p>Good day, I am getting good with Invoker.</p>
<p>Night</p>
<h1>2022-04-18</h1>
<p>I had the day for myself. I am going to write about my DND character and play some Divinity with Wolfie.</p>
<p>I also setup the vm I'll be testing on. Testing things on a VPS isn't the most ideal. Its just easy if its local.</p>
<h1>2022-04-17</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox1" checked="true"><label for="checkbox1">play lol/dota/rocket league</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox2"><label for="checkbox2">go through ahk docs</label></li>
</ul>
<p>I pushed the Mobile phones post.</p>
<p>I have been playing as Oracle for a while, time to try out another hero. I want complexity, maybe Invoker.</p>
<p>I had a dream Last night, I was back in school and it was a drawing competition and I was drawing Paani puris.</p>
<p>I played Invoker. The number of playstyles this hero can pull off is insane. Plus the number of combos. I'll only play Invoker now.</p>
<p>I rewatched Blade Runner 2049. I am going to read about Brutalist architecture.</p>
<p>I am integrating this <a href="https://github.com/sarah256/fortune-api">fortune api</a> on my site in diary section. Maybe not.</p>
<p>Invoker is fun.</p>
<p>I made my DND character today, It's an Aarakocra Druid. Me and Wolfie are going to play dnd soon.</p>
<p>Good day, Night</p>
<h1>2022-04-16</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox3"><label for="checkbox3">dockerize repo mirror(postponed)</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox4"><label for="checkbox4">push &quot;My mobile phones till now&quot;</label></li>
</ul>
<p>I'll look into Autohotkey today.</p>
<p>Looks like I'll have to make my own image for hosting the mirror thing.</p>
<p>I'll have to move to trello or org-mode for managing things. This is getting out of hand. Plus I have been helping at home.</p>
<p>Every blocker comes back to linux administration. Like for today It was setting up ssh in docker. I know, a bit meta maybe. I need to take a step back &amp; rethink.</p>
<p>I am taking a break tomorrow. Its editing &amp; drawing maybe. And I'll play League with Wolfie.</p>
<p>The Mobile phones piece is half done. I'll finish it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Night</p>
<h1>2022-04-15</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox5" checked="true"><label for="checkbox5">mirror a repo with ansible &amp; cron it</label></li>
</ul>
<p>Played dota after a long time. I need a singleplayer now.</p>
<p>I noticed the two task I plan for the day need to be related. I'll keep that mind. I suppose I could edit &amp; draw on Sundays.</p>
<p>I successfully mirrored my repos to bitbucket with ansible. Now to cronify it.<br>
Added the mirroring playbook to cron. I'll check it at night if its working.</p>
<p>I might have overengineered the mirroring thing. Eh, if it works it'll payoff.</p>
<p>For some reason I can't set the python version for ansible. Tomorrow I'll dockerize &amp; see if it works. The mirroring works fine on local with python3.8 But I am not able to set the specific version for ansible on vps.<br>
Dockerizing should solve it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll push a fragment about the phones I used. Its going to be good 😁.</p>
<p>Night</p>

</ul>
<p>There's no link styling on my site. I'll fix it today.</p>
<p>I liked playing as Brim in Valorant. I'll draw his Stim Beacon soon.</p>
<p>I'll soon setup a cyberdeck with termux.<br>
Something like this<br>

<em>Credit - <a href="https://sixohthree.com/termux-for-android">https://sixohthree.com/termux-for-android</a></em></p>
<p>I haven't been able to get alot of time on my desk. I really need a portable solution. Once I setup the vps I should be good to go with a ssh client.</p>
<p>I am looking into how to read man pages efficiently. I can write &quot;Your best friends on the CLI&quot;.</p>
<p>I like determinism. I will be tinkering with ansible for the coming week. The first problem that I want to solve is mirroring my github repos on bitbucket with ansible. This will be a good exercize to learn ansible &amp; to solve my problem.</p>
<p>Testing pushing from vps, success.</p>
<p>I setup ansible successfully. Now onto playbooks.<br>
I did it. I cloned a repo using ansible. Small victory.</p>
<p>Tomorrow if I am able to mirror 1 repo, I'll call that a win.</p>
<p>Good day, I like the fact that I am moving towards devops. I'll be one man army.</p>

<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox9" checked="true"><label for="checkbox9">watch/read Linux administration</label></li>

<a href="https://youtu.be/_M6vhDvmtrI">https://youtu.be/_M6vhDvmtrI</a></p>
<p>Good train channel, Lesics</p>
<p>I set up the networking &amp; assigned static ips to docker containers but to use those ips I need to set environment variables. I am not able to setup environment variables in create-react-app and digging into it is just not worth it.<br>
I call this mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Time to focus on linux administration.</p>
<p>Just learnt I can use service name instead of assigning static ips to containers.</p>
<p>Linux administration is very vast so I have decided to constrain myself to practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>user management</li>
<li>service management</li>
<li>process management</li>
<li>authentication</li>

<p>My progress as a dev</p>

<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox14"><label for="checkbox14">distributed computing(elixir/erlang)</label></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally added checkboxes to my site, looks good.</p>
<p>This style of keeping track is not efficient. I need to start using kanban. I have noticed there 1 big task &amp; a small one which I do get done, I need to start planning considering that.</p>
<p>I'll soon tinker around with elixir.<br>
One of the aspects where I can improve alot is testing. This is very overlooked and it really pays off in the long run. I am going to setup a tdd lab and fuck around until I get comfortable.</p>
<p>Nasty thing happened, ref lock thing on my git repo. I am making backup repos now.</p>
<p>Got a GCP vps, lets try some shit.</p>

<li>would freeze up sometimes and had to reboot<br>
I realised I am better off with i3wm. I'll soon go through all the docs of i3 and rice it up, not that I haven't. But I'll be more comfortable tweaking it if I know everything.</li>

<p>Just noticed text isn't wrapping on my site, will fix it asap</p>
<p>I need to test out multiple docker containers &amp; docker compose. I'll just grab template repos &amp; test.</p>
<p>My reading list at night</p>

I feel like I can augment <code>make</code> but this'll work for now.</p>
<p>What else can I do?</p>
<ul>
<li>one click deployment</li>
<li>one click dev spin up</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean theres not much to it, but I can use my portfolio to test it.</p>
<p>Came across my first hurdle, hot reloading. Lets figure that out.<br>
Will be solved with volume mapping.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I am really good at my art is automation. If I ever notice repeating myself, I automate it.</p>
<p>Mapping the volume enables hot reloading, yayyyyy, EZ.</p>
<p>I am using make file for now, It should do the job. I'll use docker-compose.yml when the need arises. Plus I wanna use makefiles, I want to integrate them in my workflow.</p>
<p>I really need to edit my videos. I will edit them for the coming days along with tinkering with docker.</p>
<p>Actually good day considering I worked relatively less than usual but got more done. Working while cycling is cool.</p>

<p>Been having eyestrain past these days, gonna go get my eyes checked.</p>
<p>Got myself some glasses with the shades thingy, EZ.</p>
<p>Docker starts tomorrow, no matter what.</p>
<p>The current exwm setup feels sufficient. I don't have a system tray but I don't miss it.<br>
I have decided to continue using it for now and rice it when I feel the need for.</p>
<p>I'll try to setup docker playground now.<br>
Tried docker, it feels pretty easy. Its just linux with some automation.<br>
I'll deep dive now.</p>
<p>I got my glasses and OMG it feels so trippy. Everythings so clear.<br>
Idk how I managed until now. I wanna go to places just to see things this clear.</p>
<p>I can see things on my pc from bed. This power... its too much. I have a fucking scope.</p>
<p>I looked more into docker, it feels just linux. Thats it.<br>
Shouldn't be hard to master it.</p>

Fragments worthy.</p>
<p>I recently switched to firefox and it feels snappy. Snappier than Chrome.</p>
<p>For essentials, system tray is left in exwm. For some reason exwm-systray isn't available. I'll have to use something else</p>

<p>I noticed I haven't been using emacs alot for the past few days.<br>
And that changes today, I am installing exwm and making it my default window manager.<br>
Its everything emacs baby.</p>
<p>Installed evil-mode. Best of both worlds. Since I am comfortable with emacs and I like vim's keybinds, this setup is comfortable<br>
than grabbing a distribution.</p>
<p>I'll spend the day today configuring exwm and evil keybinds.</p>
<p>Exwm with evil mode turned out to be a bit of hassle, my browser windows turn read only. This is something I'll look into later on.<br>
Vanilla emacs exwm it is for me for now.</p>
<p>I looked up about <code>ssh-add</code> persistence and I came across <code>ssh-add -K /path/to/key</code>. Lets see if this works.<br>
It did prompt me once. Let me try again. Nope, no luck.</p>
<p>Figured out how to show the command keybind in minibuffer completion. One of the best things.<br>
Added it in fragments. ezpz.</p>
<p>Need to setup gif recordings &amp; add assets from fragments.</p>
<p>One of these days I'll make an emacs artwork.</p>
<h1>2022-04-05</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox27"><label for="checkbox27">Edit with Kdenlive</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox28" checked="true"><label for="checkbox28">Add </label><code>fragments</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I'll take a look at Davinci Resolve fusion nodes today.<br>
I might try NixOS in a VM. The documentation is very good.</p>
<p>I tried out clojure today. It feels like it has more support due to being on JVM, but thats just how I feel.<br>
One of the biggest reason I haven't gotten really good at lisp is lack of documentation &amp; discoverability.<br>
I want an emacs package which'll list out all the packages, functions, classes and let me browse through just like any smalltalk implementation.</p>
<p>I skimmed through fusion nodes. It seems like I can use frequently used effects as nodes. I'll look into it soon.</p>
<p>Added base <code>fragments</code>. This will work for now. Since I have fragments up and running now would be a good time<br>
to look for a good git android app. Fragments can be anything which doesn't belong in diary or worth calling a good piece, its like youtube shorts or a 1 man twitter.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I edit my 2nd video with Kdenlive. I'll lookup some basic seo as well.</p>
<p>Calling it a day, Night friend</p>
<h1>2022-04-04</h1>
<p>Davinci Resolve is taking too much time. Jun recommended to chunk it so I can experiment with</p>
<ul>
<li>other editing programs</li>
<li>editing styles</li>
</ul>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox29" checked="true"><label for="checkbox29">Release first chunk of </label><code>Solving Clojure Koans</code></li>
</ul>
<p>First video is out, yayyyyy.</p>
<p>I have a purpose now. Puzzle life and the biggest puzzle is my life.</p>
<p>I'll make the portal companion cube artwork and make it as my channel logo.</p>
<p>Since I have one content for <code>shorts</code>, I can start working on it today.</p>
<p>I am not calling it <code>shorts</code>, its <code>fragments</code>.</p>
<p>I want an electric bicycle. I'll buy it next year.</p>
<p>I finally made the companion cube. This will be my official logo everywhere now.<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarusll/artworks/main/companion_cube/cube.svg" alt="Companion Cube"></p>
<p>I finished watching <code>The way of the househusband</code>, pretty wholesome. I'll read the manga now</p>
<p>20 mins, not enough.</p>
<p>Instead of figuring things out how to filter, I'll just push <code>fragments</code> for now. I'll manage filtering later on. So I can finish base implementation tomorrow.</p>
<p>I'll push the videos every alternate days so I can get comfortable with an editor in a day and push the video next day.</p>
<p>From what I've read Latin feels like the lisp of languages. I might give it a try.</p>
<p>Night friend.</p>
<h1>2022-04-03</h1>
<p>finished clojurescript koans first thing in the morning.</p>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox30"><label for="checkbox30">come up with a design for shorts</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox31" checked="true"><label for="checkbox31">edit clojurescript koans videos</label></li>
</ul>
<p>I need to start making realistic plans. Looking back I am not able to finish everything I plan for. I'll be easing it now.<br>
In a day, I am only able to do one big task. So I'll just plan a semi big task for a day.</p>
<p>I have been using mechvibes since yesterday. Its cool. <a href="https://mechvibes.com">https://mechvibes.com</a>. I like the sound of Blacks. Blues have this springy tone at the end<br>
and its annoying.</p>
<p>I forgot to delete my lightsail instances and I've been charged for 3 months now. I did disable the instance.</p>
<p>Things I need to do for the edit</p>
<ul>
<li>Line up the videos</li>
<li>Transitions(maybe)</li>
<li>Background music(lofi chill)</li>
<li>Color grading(warm and low contrast)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is just too much to learn about video editing. I will give this a day more.<br>
I am blurring things out right now. I am yet to add text banners. Commentary is out of the question.</p>
<p>Editing is a bitch. I did an amateur of not doing things in incognito and I now have to blur things out. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
<p>I have the videos lined up &amp; blurred out whatever needed to be.<br>
I am going to take a break. I'll add the text banners now and it should be good to go.</p>
<p>I am calling it a day. I'll finish editing it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Night friend.</p>

</ul>
<p>I'll read some short stories today.<br>
One of these days need to think about seamless images integration on portfolio. I can add image in diary but they get added in diary repo, that directory hasn't been configured for images. There will be more resources directories in future. Need a futureproof(enough) solution.</p>
<p>Next week I'll setup RSS for my portfolio.</p>
<p><img src="/images/45c1d0ac5c158dbe491e518249607dc5.jpg" alt="My Setup"><br>
<em>My Setup</em></p>
<p>Testing image.<br>
Needs to be prefixed by <code>/images/</code>. Testing again.<br>
Works.</p>
<p>Images can be easily added by passthrough copy in 11ty. The raw images uploaded from phone would be unoptimized but this will suffice for now.</p>
<p>I am still yet to design the setup for shorts. Since there will be lots of posts, I will need filtering.</p>
<p>Halfway through clojure koans.<br>
Once I have a stable recording setup I can start recording other things.</p>

<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox37" checked="true"><label for="checkbox37">fuck around github copilot</label></li>
</ul>
<p>I'll start applying for jobs soon.</p>
<p>I love github copilot. No, it won't make people lose their jobs, it'll help them grow as a dev.<br>
One of the things will be sensible names when they try to use copilot suggestions. For me it'll be generating boilerplate, discoverability(with caution)<br>
and automating trivial things. I will decompose my problem more and thus improve my code quality.</p>
<p>I have made a Point class library for fun. That library can have some more functions if I had Angle class. I will be making the Angle class<br>
with the help of github copilot. Lets see how this goes.</p>
<p>Looks like there's no pornhub comments api, just scraping solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://game.postdoesnotexist.com/">https://game.postdoesnotexist.com/</a> - Good game</p>
<p><code>faces</code> are typefaces in emacs. Can customize to my liking.</p>
<p>I was thinking about making a <code>shorts</code> section on my site. There are things which shouldn't go in my diary but shorts.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be working on shorts section. I was also planning on doing screencasts. Maybe I can combine both of these in one section. They will be fragments of cool things which don't belong in my diary.</p>

<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox38" checked="true"><label for="checkbox38">finish elisp koans</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox39"><label for="checkbox39">draw portal companion cube</label></li>
</ul>
<p>Have been looking into guix, this is definitely something I'll look into someday.</p>
<p>I feel like I have familiarized myself with emacs well to move around quick enough. Next plan would be to setting custom keybinds.</p>
<p>Emacs has a diary. I looked into it. My current setup works for now given that I push from my phone as well.</p>
<p>All this time I have been on a scavenged linux setup. I picked the first obvious solution &amp; stuck to it. I really want to craft a system and stick to it.<br>
The setup will be</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal</li>
<li>stable</li>
<li>deterministic</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't looked at guix yet but scheme as config language does seem appealing to me plus its something new so fun.</p>
<p>I read some of &quot;One more thing: stories &amp; other stories&quot;. Good short stories.</p>
<p>I looked at nixos, I like the idea. Now I need to find out &amp; justify if it works for me.</p>
<p>I finished the koans, there are 2 koans but they are exercise. I might do them if I feel like it. Right now, I have to digest some elisp. I'll come back to these after a day or two.</p>
<p>Haven't been able to do alot these days because I have been helping at home. If it becomes extreme I might look for a laptop or travel keyboard so I can work from phone.</p>
<p>Good day, night friend.</p>

</ul>
<p>Easy day, woke up late. Need to fix my sleep schedule. I wish I can get back my lost sleep but that's not possible.</p>
<p>I'll draw the portal companion cube today.</p>
<p>One of these days need to think about seo. It feels spammy and unethical. I'll keep it clean.</p>
<p>Found out a really sweet <a href="http://clojurescriptkoans.com/">Clojure Koans website</a>. Will give it a try soon.</p>
<p>Helped out Xeon with his assignment today. Java isn't that bad. I'll give it a try someday.</p>
<p><code>&quot;CL (and elisp!) provides the programmer with more than enough rope to hang themself.&quot;</code> - <em>elisp-koans</em></p>
<p>I like introspection. Thats one of the big reasons I like emacs &amp; smalltalk.</p>
<h1>2022-03-29</h1>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>

<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox42" checked="true"><label for="checkbox42">figure out data sources for d2newspaper</label></li>

<li><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox44" checked="true"><label for="checkbox44">watch system crafters</label></li>
</ul>
<p>Came across <code>elcord-mode</code>, discord rich presense for emacs. Looks cool.<br>
<code>recentf-mode</code>, remembers all the recent files. I am using it now.</p>
<p>Just found out about <code>describe-symbol</code> in emacs. It gives documentation about elisp symbols.</p>
<p>One thing that I really want to master in emacs is motions, moving around in buffer fast, really fast. Thats the thing I liked about Vim alot. If I can make it happen here, I won't need any vi emulation modes.</p>
<p>One of these days I'll draw the portal companion cube artwork. I got one online but it seems unethical. I'll make my own.</p>
<p>Seems like <code>ssh-add</code> doesn't persist. I don't know how long but it doesn't. I am trying out <code>git config credential.helper store</code>. Lets see if this works.</p>
<p>I know just enough about elisp so that I can read the manual &amp; get stuff done.<br>
Also the credential helper thing doesn't store any ssh keys. I'll have to look into it soon.</p>
<p>Found out <code>which-key</code>, It lists all the commands available in current mode.<br>
Here's a preview from <img src="https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key/raw/master/img/which-key-bottom.png" alt="justbur/emacs-which-key"><br>
This is very helpful. I can just scroll through the commands to see what action I want, It shows the keybind as well. After a while it'll become second nature.</p>
<p>Me and Wolfie figured out how to get all the data for d2newspaper. We'll be using jq to filter out. Should be easy. ezpz.</p>
<p>Holy shit <code>which-key</code> is fucking awesome. If I enable <code>which-key-mode</code>, I can type out Key combinations and wait for the suggestions. This is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Actually good day, learnt alot about Emacs. Day rating - 6/10. Tomorrow I'll try to finish elisp-koans.<br>
Ez, night friend</p>

<p>The mount is here. Power tools are scary.<br>
I have enough desk space now, I can use my drawing tablet.<br>
I set it up everything. I ll play Far Changing Tides, I've earned it.</p>
<p>I'll be messing around with emacs lisp for a while. My goal is to start talking in terms of emacs objects like buffers, windows &amp; frames and then write some trivial macros.</p>
<p>Man I love magit, I am quickly able to do git actions which is letting me make rapid small changes. Good stuff.</p>
<p>I'll be trying out <a href="https://github.com/jtmoulia/elisp-koans">elisp koans</a><br>
I did some elisp koans. I expected emacs types but this is standard lisp stuff.<br>
Anyways the youtube series by System Crafters should get me upto speed with emacs types.</p>
<p>I wanted to open my diary file quickly, I came across emacs registers. You can store any thing, good stuff. I stored my diary file at d. So I can access it by <code>C-x r j d</code> from anywhere in emacs. ezpz.</p>
<p>Easy day, pushed &quot;What motivates me&quot;, started with elisp. System crafters should get me upto speed with Emacs.</p>
<p>Planned about d2newspaper. Lets make this happen.</p>

<p>Man i love playing Oracle</p>
<p>I have my <code>posts</code> repo as gitsubmodule in <code>portfolio</code> repo and whenever I make a change in posts, I have to commit it twice, once in <code>post</code> &amp; once in <code>portfolio</code>.<br>
I just want to commit once and be done</p>
<p>Integrated Dark mode, ezpz</p>
<p>One of these days, need to plan about decoupling the submodules and building the site on push of any dependency repos</p>
<p>Oh hello git submodules</p>
<p>I did it, ahahah. I am a fucking god. I successfully tested GitHub actions trigger on push in submodule repo.</p>
<p>Lets see if this works.</p>
<p>Yes it does, ahahahahahahaah.</p>
<p>Automated site build on submodule push. I did it for diary so I can write from phone, push and everything will just work. Tomorrow I'll do the same for posts</p>
