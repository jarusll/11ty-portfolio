    <h1>My Editor Journey Till Now</h1>
<h2>What did I start with?</h2>
<p><strong>2018</strong></p>
<p>My first editor was Emacs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Why did I choose emacs? I couldn't figure out how to exit Vim<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I got really into programming with Scheme<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>. And I liked it so much I decided to choose the editor with its root in it.</p>
<p>I learnt to use emacs but never really learnt it. The power of emacs comes from extensibility. Although I am a casual lisp programmer, I never bothered to learn elisp and extend emacs to my liking.</p>
<h2>Why did I switch?</h2>
<p><strong>2020</strong></p>
<p>The elisp<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> configs dint make any sense. The packages and I felt slow in emacs. Although I am partly to be blame for not harnessing its power.</p>
<p>I decided to switch to Vim in 2020.<br>
I like that just about any action is 1-3+ click/s away. I felt fast, really fast.<br>
I felt so fast that I started using it everywhere. I use Vimium in my browser.<br>
I use i3wm which has vim-like keybinds. I use vim keybinds in online ides for prototyping. I wish it was everywhere.</p>
<h2>Why I am switching again?</h2>
<p><strong>2022</strong></p>
<p>I have recently been tinkering with smalltalk. The Pharo(or any smalltalk) IDE has been one of the best IDEs I have ever used. I know when I miss vim because I feel slow. But I never felt slow in Pharo's IDE. Its because you are able to reach just about anywhere within few clicks. I realised I was getting more done and was managing very less code. It made me think about extensibility.</p>
<p>And this made me change my mind. Its about time I did emacs properly.</p>
<h2>What do I plan to achieve?</h2>
<p>One day I will start my day by opening emacs and I'll end it by closing emacs.<br>
This is what I am aiming for.</p>
<h2>What about Vim?</h2>
<p>I will use vim for quick edits. I will continue using it in my browser. Emacs support in browser is not functional. The motions in vim are very powerful and I plan to use Spacemacs after I get comfortable with elisp.</p>
