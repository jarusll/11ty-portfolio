  <h1>A game which I will make(someday)</h1>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I have been playing alot of Oracle in Dota. I like the fact that he's a double edged sword.<br>
The spell combos feel like a mini game itself and I think I can make a game out of it.</p>
<h2>Gameplay loop</h2>
<p>For those who don't know Oracle's spells, heres a quick introduction</p>
<h3>Fortune's End</h3>
<p>A channeled ability which roots[^root] the enemy. Can be casted on enemy or ally. When casted on ally, purges all debuffs[^debuff]. When casted on enemy, purges all buffs[^buff].</p>
<h3>Fate's Edict</h3>
<p>Can be casted on ally as well as enemy. When casted, it disarms &amp; saves the player from magic damage.</p>
<h3>Purifying Flames</h3>
<p>Can be casted on ally as well as enemy. It gives a burst damage and then heals overtime. The heal is greater than the damage given.</p>
<h3>False Promise</h3>
<p>Can be casted on ally. It delays all the damage and healing during False Promise and healing is doubled.</p>
<h2>Combos</h2>
<h3>Heal allies</h3>
<p>Cast Fate's Edict to save from magical damage, stack them with Purifying Flames so they get healing without any damage.</p>
<h3>Punish enemies</h3>
<p>Cast Purifying Flames, wait for cooldown, Cast one more Purifying Flames quickly followed by Fortune's End to purge healing.</p>
<h2>Mobs</h2>
<p>Since it comes from Dota, enemies will have both magic and pure damage.</p>
<h2>Surrounding World</h2>
<p>I haven't decided on the world. I would probably make it like mario's worlds.</p>
<h2>2D or 3D?</h2>
<p>2D, since I will be the only one making it.</p>
<h2>Monetization?</h2>
<p>NO, since its Valve's IP.</p>
