  <h1>What motivates me (I think)</h1>
<p>2 things</p>
<ul>
<li>Variety</li>
<li>Speed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Variety</h2>
<p>I have noticed about myself that I like heterogeneity whether it comes to programming or food or games. They are like flavours I want to try and I want to try all of them. It helps me grow as an individual. Its the same reason why I tried Object oriented programming when I was a hardcore functional programmer, why I mix my food unevenly so that every bite will taste different and why I explore every part of the game so that I don't miss out on an experience. Maybe its evolution playing that I am constantly on the hunt for something new.</p>
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>This one's easy, I just don't want to be slow. I want to be good at my art which means being efficient. I am speedrunning experiences.</p>
<p>I do believe that any form of extremism is bad. I try to be virtuous while balancing myself.<br>
Being around passionate individuals motivates me as well.</p>
<p>Have a good one stranger.</p>
