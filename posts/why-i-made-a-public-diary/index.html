  <h1>Why I made a public diary</h1>
<p>I have kept things to myself all my life, because I found it hard to open up to people.<br>
And that did not help. Communication is what makes us humans(probably).</p>
<p>I have defintely matured to open up.<br>
Now, I try to be an open book. I want people to see me as me. I want them to know where I come from.</p>
<p>This diary will be my own corner. Also it'll help me keep track of things.</p>
<p>Have a good one stranger.</p>
